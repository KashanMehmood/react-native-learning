1.  What is Component
    Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these.
    Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.

    a. we use lifecycle method,states in class component
    b. we use hook in functional component
    c. functional component has no scope it uses parent scope.

2.  Flexbox
    1. In the following example, the red, yellow, and green views are all children in the container view that has flex: 1 set. The red view uses flex: 1 , the yellow view uses flex: 2, and the green view uses flex: 3 . 1+2+3 = 6, which means that the red view will get 1/6 of the space, the yellow 2/6 of the space, and the green 3/6 of the space.
